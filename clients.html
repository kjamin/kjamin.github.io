        <h1 class="heading">Client Engagement Timeline</h1>
        <p>Client engagements are spread across a semester (3-4 months). You can expect an initial meeting with a Project Leader, who will discuss potential engagements and better understand your needs. The Project Leader will then construct a Statement of Work with you that includes a rough draft of the project problem, timeline, and expected deliverables. This will give you a strategic understanding of how your dedicated 180 Degrees Consulting team is scoping your company problem.</p>
